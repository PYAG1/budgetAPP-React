Every university student can testify that it is sometimes difficult to keep account of your spendings.

Created a responsive budget app to help you keep track of your expenses.

You can add and delete both budgets and expenses as well as view them.

Budgets do not get cleared when the page is refreshed.

This app was created using React.js and Reactbootstrap.

It was fun making this because I was introduced to new concepts in React.
